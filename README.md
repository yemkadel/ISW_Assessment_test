# ISW ASSESSMENT README

This readme file contains the algorithm to the solution used for the coding test

## Algorithm

    1. Check the length of the text
	2. if text length is greater than 300, return the first 300 characters
	3. Check the length of the new text
	4. if new text length is equal to 3, return text in uppercase format.
